\paragraph{Nucleo-144}
The Nucleo-144 uses ST's STM32F7 microcontroller. It could therefore be classified as more of a microcontroller than a SBC. It has a single-core processer with a clock speed of 216MHz and 256kB of RAM \cite{nucleoDatasheet}. It therefore has markedly less processing power in contrast to the other boards reviewed. The Nucleo-144 also lacks a GPU as well as a HDMI port and this makes it unsuitable for the purposes of this project.
