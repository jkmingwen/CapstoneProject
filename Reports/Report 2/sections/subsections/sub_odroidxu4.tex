\paragraph{Odroid XU4}
The Odroid XU4 runs off Samsung's Exynos-5422 SoC \cite{odroidDatasheet}. It has two quad-core processors with clock speeds of 2GHz and 1.3GHz respectively and a GPU with a clock speed of 600MHz. Furthermore, measuring 83x58mm, its dimensions are comparable to the Raspberry Pi. Nonetheless, it has 2GB of RAM, which is much lower than those of the Jetson TX2 and the HiKey 970. That said, given these specifications, as long as the video synthesizer's animations are not too computationally expensive, it should still be a good candidate on which to implement the program.
