\paragraph{Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+}
The Raspberry Pi is currently the best selling SBC on the market \cite{Johnston2018}. The Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, which uses the Broadcom BCM2837B0 SoC, is the latest in its range \cite{rpiDatasheet}. Measuring 85x56mm, it is also one of the smaller SBCs which makes it more. Nonetheless, the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ might not be suitable for this project as it does not have a GPU. This means that it will likely be less suited to rendering graphics compared to other boards that do have GPUs.
