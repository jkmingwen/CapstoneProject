\paragraph{HiKey 970}
The HiKey 970 uses Huawei's Kirin 970 SoC \cite{hikeyDatasheet}. With two quad-core processors with clock speeds of 2.36GHz and 1.8GHz respectively, the HiKey 970 definitely one of the higher processing capabilities amongst the boards being reviewed. It does have a GPU, albeit one with a lower clock speed than the Jetson TX2. It also has HDMI and USB ports along with relatively small dimensions of 100x85mm, which makes it one of the better candidates for this project.
