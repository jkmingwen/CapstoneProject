\paragraph{Jetson TX2}
The Jetson TX2 is manufactured by Nvidia. It uses Nvidia's Tegra TX2 SoC. It is apparent from the specifications that the Jetson TX2 has much greater processing capabilities than the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+. The Jetson TX2 also has a GPU --- specifically the NVIDIA Pascal 256-core with a clock speed of 1300MHz \cite{jetsonDatasheet}. It has the highest GPU clock speed amongst the SBCs reviewed --- potentially having the highest graphics processing capabilities amongst the boards reviewed. One of the factors that needs to be considered, however, is its size. With dimensions of 170x170mm, its one of the larger SBCs being reviewed.
